## Basic Operations
### Text Object
word only contains letters, digits, underscore, and etc.
WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white spaces

`aw` a word
`aW` a WORD
`iw` inner word
`iW` inner WORD
`as` sentence
`ap` paragraph
`a[` or `a[` []
`a(` or `a)` ()
`a{` or `a}` {}
`a>` or `a<` <>
`at` tag block
`ab` block
`a'` single quote block
`a‚Äù` double quote block
`\`` \` quote block

`ai` indent block
`ii` indent block

### Delete
`dw` deletes a word starting from the cursor to the word end
`dW` deletes a whole word including special characters, split by spaces
`de / dE` are similar
`daw` deletes a word under the cursor and spaces after it
`diw` deletes a inner word no separators
`b + dw` should be the same as `dw`
`dt<c>` deletes till `<c>` character
`df<c>` deletes tile `<c>` character, include `<c>`

### Search
#### Locally
`/abc` to search "abc" in open file, `n` to next, `N` to previous
`#`, `*` to search current word and navigate

#### Globally
`:grep -r --include=*.rb app` to search all ruby files in "app" directory recursively
`:grep!` to prevent grep open the first mateched file
`:grep 'abc' app/**/*.rb` should do the same trick, however, it may miss some file depending on the system, so **do not use this**
`:copen`, `:cw[indow]` to open Quickfix window

### Indentation
#### Set Indentation Values
```
# by default, the indent is 2 spaces. 
set shiftwidth=2
set softtabstop=2
set tabstop=2

# for html/rb files, 2 spaces
autocmd Filetype html setlocal ts=2 sw=2 expandtab
autocmd Filetype ruby setlocal ts=2 sw=2 expandtab

# for js/coffee/jade files, 4 spaces
autocmd Filetype javascript setlocal ts=4 sw=4 sts=0 expandtab
autocmd Filetype coffeescript setlocal ts=4 sw=4 sts=0 expandtab
autocmd Filetype jade setlocal ts=4 sw=4 sts=0 expandtab
```

#### Operations
```
>>   Indent line by shiftwidth spaces
<<   De-indent line by shiftwidth spaces
5>>  Indent 5 lines
5==  Re-indent 5 lines

>%   Increase indent of a braced or bracketed block (place cursor on brace first)
=%   Reindent a braced or bracketed block (cursor on brace)
<%   Decrease indent of a braced or bracketed block (cursor on brace)
]p   Paste text, aligning indentation with surroundings

=i{  Re-indent the 'inner block', i.e. the contents of the block
=a{  Re-indent 'a block', i.e. block and containing braces
=2a{ Re-indent '2 blocks', i.e. this block and containing block

>i{  Increase inner block indent
<i{  Decrease inner block indent
```

In insert mode
```
ctrl+t    to indent
ctrl+d    to reverse-indent
```


## Buffer
### Add a buffer
```

### Delete multiple buffers
```
:bdelete buf1.txt buf2.c buf3.h
:bdelete buf
```

### Wipeout a buffer
```
:bw[ipeout] 4
```

### Navigate between buffers
```
:ls         - list open buffers
:b N        - open buffer number N (as shown in ls)
:tabe +Nbuf - open buffer number N in new tab
:bnext      - go to the next buffer (:bn also)
:bprevious  - go to the previous buffer (:bp also)
